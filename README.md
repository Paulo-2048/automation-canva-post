> The project essentially involves creating a #scraper with Puppeteer on the website https://lnkd.in/drhxDe3 using #nodejs and extracting the trending topics to a #google spreadsheet. Later, retrieve this information and use it to create a graphic art on #canva, followed by uploading it to Google Drive.

> Note: Many selectors and links may need to be changed, removed, or added according to your needs, as they tend to change, for example, the class name. (But if you have any questions, feel free to contact me on LinkedIn, and I'll be happy to help: https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulo-vitor-92174b148/)
